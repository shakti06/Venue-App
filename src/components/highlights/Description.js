          Adele Laurie Blue Adkins (born May 5, 1988) is a British
          singer-songwriter who has sold millions of albums worldwide and won a
          total of 15 Grammys as well as an Oscar. Adeleâ€™s first two albums, 19
          and 21, earned her critical praise and a level of commercial success
          unsurpassed among her peers. After becoming a mom in 2012, Adele
          returned to the charts with the ballad "Hello" in 2015, the lead
          single from what was dubbed her comeback album 25. In 2017 she won
          five Grammys for her work on 25, including album, record and song of
          the year.
